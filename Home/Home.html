            <h2 class="h2-about-me">About Me</h2>
                <p class="about-me-p">I am a U.S. Army Veteran of 4.5 years as a Human Resources Specialist and Team Leader while serving in the military. 
                I presently hold an Active Secret Clearance. I've Spent the last 4.5 years in Human resources building indispensable life and work skills that helped 
                me overcome many challenges. Some of of my positions have included Team Supervisor and Team leader where I was in a leadership position in charge of 10 Soldiers.
                After transitioning out of the Army I didn't know what I was going to next, a year after being out of the military I got into coding. I always thought that learning how to code
                was something near impossible to learn, until I tried it for myself and learned it wasnt that difficult. I was making slow progress but miraculously  Udemy had a sale on all of
                their programs and now I am learning at a much faster pace. Coding is something that I love to do and use up all my free time trying to learn. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer
                in the future. I will be attending University in spring of 2024 and persuing a Bachelors in Computer Science with an estimated graduation year of 2027.
